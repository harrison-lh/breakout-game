## Interesting Breakout Variants
I really like the Centipong variant, with (1) the concept of having a
massive number of balls exploding out after hitting a "block", and (2)
the power-up that slows down time that becomes more interesting combined 
with the large number of balls on screen. Otherwise, I think I also like
the Super Breakout, but mostly because of its implementation of a few
new features in a relatively minimalistic manner. While I like the chaotic
nature of Centipong, there is also something to say about the zen-like
gameplay of having a single ball (or just a few balls) and slowly
building up in Super Breakout.

## Paddle Ideas
1. Having the balls be influenced by the direction that the paddle is moving
   (i.e. incorporating momentum into the paddle-ball interaction).
   
2. Warping of the paddle between the left and right side of the screen.

## Block Ideas
1. Multiple-hit blocks

2. Certain blocks drop extra lives and/or power-ups

3. Blocks of different sizes/shapes

## Power-up Ideas
1. Ball grows in size over time, which makes it easier to hit with the paddle

2. Large balls can burst into many smaller balls

3. One power-up will slow time, allowing the player the ability to hit 
   more small balls with the paddle in a short period of game time

4. A laser can clear a whole column of blocks

## Cheat Key Ideas
1. One key will increment the player's counter for remaining lives

2. Enables blocks to be destroyed if hit by a ball regardless of how 
   strong the block is
   
3. Immediately shoots a column laser from the paddle

4.
