### Running the Program

pointspower.gif, laserpower.gif, paddle.gif

### Notes/Assumptions

Assumptions or Simplifications:

Known Bugs: Blocks sometimes spawn already broken depending on how the previous scene was set up,
the exploding block only collides with one other block (thus only exploding one block)

Extra credit:


### Impressions
I sincerely apologize for whomever is looking at my construct level method; I did not realize that an outside
data input was desired until far too late.
